# TV Show Search Platform
The TV Show Search Platform is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the search for TV shows based on keywords. Leveraging the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm, this platform extracts relevant information from TV show subtitles, making it easier for users to find shows matching their interests.

## Features
- Keyword Search: Users can input keywords to find TV shows related to specific topics or themes.

- TF-IDF Algorithm: The platform utilizes the TF-IDF algorithm to calculate the importance of keywords within the TV show subtitles. This allows for efficient and accurate matching.

- Subtitle Analysis: The platform extracts and analyzes words from TV show subtitles to enhance the search functionality.

## How It Works
- Keyword Input: Users enter keywords related to the TV shows they are looking for.

- TF-IDF Matching: The platform applies the TF-IDF algorithm to identify TV shows that best match the provided keywords. This ensures that shows with a higher relevance to the input keywords are ranked higher in the search results.

- Subtitle Extraction: The platform extracts and analyzes words from TV show subtitles to strengthen the matching process. This enables a more comprehensive understanding of the show's content.

- Search Results: Users receive a list of TV shows ranked according to their relevance to the input keywords. This makes it easier for users to discover shows that align with their interests.

## What I Learned
Building the TV Show Search Platform involved tackling substantial amounts of data and extracting relevant information efficiently. Here are some key learnings from the project:

- Data Cleaning with Python: I gained proficiency in using Python for cleaning and processing large datasets. This involved removing irrelevant information and extracting key details needed for the TF-IDF algorithm.

- TF-IDF Implementation: I learned how to implement the TF-IDF algorithm to calculate the importance of keywords within a collection of TV show subtitles. This algorithm played a crucial role in determining the relevance of shows to user-inputted keywords.

- Subtitle Analysis Techniques: Extracting meaningful information from TV show subtitles required the development of effective analysis techniques. This involved understanding natural language processing concepts to enhance the accuracy of keyword matching.

- Efficient Data Extraction: Dealing with a large amount of data required the development of efficient data extraction processes. This involved selecting and extracting relevant information to optimize the search functionality.
